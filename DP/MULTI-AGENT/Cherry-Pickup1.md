# CHERRY PICKUP-1
- Try here :https://leetcode.com/problems/cherry-pickup/description/

- Rather than doing 2 DFS (Top-Left to Btm Right and Back to Top Left) , go with 2 player simultaneous DFS
### WHY so ?
- Attain global maxima , by get the max sum of cell over 2 paths 1 for forward & other one for back traversal
- if P1 , P2 over the same cells then only consider take the grid[r][c] once  . as once taken can't be taken once
- Keep in mind as soon as one of those reaches the lastcell grid[n-1][n-1] return the val , because last cell is also need to be considered at max once
- We are doing simultaneous 2 player traversal , allows us not to mark the cell from forward to last cell as 0 (taken cherry) eliminating the need to explicitly keep track of paths , unlike what is to be done in 2 dfs {start to last and back to start}
-The reason a conventional two-pass DFS (start to end, then end to start) fails to guarantee a global maximum is that the first pass makes decisions that permanently alter the grid for the second pass.

    }
    int solve(int r1 , int c1 , int r2 , int c2 , vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        if (r1 >= n || c1 >= n || r2 >= n || c2 >= n ||  grid[r1][c1] == -1 || grid[r2][c2] == -1 ) {
            return INT_MIN ;
