# POP-SEQUENCE - VALIDDATION

- For numbers [0,n-1] validation whether any seq made by insertion of in stack while assigning value inorder from 0-n-1
- Ie stack is used as a temp storage and , seq is generated by pop out values from the stack , check whether the seq generated was actually pushed in stack in order from `0->n-1`

- take ele upto the peak and match is the element in stack and accordingly pop out the elements
- If stack->empty at the end then all values in seq are assigned by pushing and popping out values from stack somehow  and value would have been pushed 0->n-1

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stack>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n ;
    cin >> n ;
    stack<int> stk ;
    int next_peak = 0 ;

    for (int i = 0; i < n ;i ++) {
        int curr_ele ;
        cin >> curr_ele ;

        while (next_peak <= curr_ele) {
            stk.push(next_peak) ;
            next_peak++ ;
        }
        if (!stk.empty() && stk.top() == curr_ele) stk.pop();
    }
    if (!stk.empty()) {
        cout << "No" << endl ;
    }else {
        cout << "Yes" << endl ;
    }
    return 0;
}
```
